# Module 4 Challenge

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this project was to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while not messing up the rest of the recorded data. The school district analysis then had to be redone and a report to be written on the changes. The average scores and many different school levels will be found as well. 

## Results
-The average math scores changed from 79 to 78.9 when the scores of the Thomas High School Ninth Grade students were taken out.
-The percent of students passing math went from 75% to 74%.
-The percent of students passing Reading went from 86% to 85%.
-The percent of students passing overall went from 65% to 64%.
-The average reading scores did not change.
-The average Math at Thomas High School decreased from 83.42 to 83.35.
-The average Reading at Thomas slightly increased from 83.84 to 83.89.
-The average Percent Passing Math at Thomas High School greatly decreased from 93.3% to 66.9%.
-The percent Passing Reading at Thomas High School decreases from 97.3% to 69.7%.
-The average percent overall passing both Math and Reading decreased from 90.9% to 65.1%.

## Summary

Replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores definitely affected their performance relative to the other schools. They used to be in the top 10, and after adjusting the scores with NaNs, it is no longer in that top 10 list. 
-When the grades were removed, the overall percentage of students that passed decreased from 62.9% to 56.4%.
-The charter schools average math scores declines 0.01%. 
The average reading scores at the charter school went higher 0.01%.
-The percentage of people passing math at the charter school declined 3.3%.
-The percentage over overall people passing at the charter school declined 3.2%.
-Removing the grades of the Thomas High School students reduces the percent passing math and reading as well as the overall passing percentage.
-Removing students from the 9th grade class reduces the percent passing math and reading as well as the percent of overall passing students.
